Here, \"distributed\" just means that the representations are vectors of real numbers, and these models are also often called __vector space models__ (VSMs). The focus is largely on methods derived from co-occcurrence patterns in text, but the section [Supervised signals](#Supervised-signals) illustrates a simple method for imbuing distributional word vectors with label information.\n",

      "0. Scan through your corpus building a dictionary $d$ mapping word-pairs to counts. Every time a pair of words $w$ and $w'$ occur in the same context (as you defined it in 1),  increment $d[(w, w')]$ by $1$.\n",
      "0. Using the count dictionary $d$ that you collected in 2, establish your full vocabulary $V$, an ordered list of words types. For large collections of documents, $|V|$ will typically be huge. You will probably want to winnow the vocabulary at this point. You might do this by filtering to a specific subset, or just imposing a minimum count threshold. You might impose a minimum count threshold even if $|V|$ is small &mdash; for words with very low counts, you simply don't have enough evidence to say anything interesting.\n",
      "0. Now build a matrix $M$ of dimension $|V| \\times |V|$. Both the rows and the columns of $M$ represent words. Each cell $M[i, j]$ is filled with the count $d[(w_i, w_j)]$.\n",
      "\n",
      "For different design matrices, the procedure differs slightly. For example, if you are building a word $\\times$ document matrix, then the rows of $M$ represent words and the columns of $M$ represent documents. The scan in step 2 then just keeps track of (_word_, _document_) pairs &mdash; compiling the number of times that _word_ appears in _document_. Such matrices are often used in information retrieval, because the columns are multi-set representations of documents. They are much sparser than the the word $\\times$ word matrices we will work with here. (In my experience, they yield lower quality lexicons, but others have reported good results with them.)"
