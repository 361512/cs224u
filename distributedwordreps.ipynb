    "This codelab is about methods for creating effective distributed semantic word representations. Here, \"distributed\" just means that the representations are vectors of real numbers, and these models are also often called __vector space models__ (VSMs). My focus is largely on methods derived from co-occurrence patterns in text, but the section [Supervised signals](#Supervised-signals) illustrates a simple method for imbuing distributional word vectors with label information.\n",

    "A usage note: the term __distributional representatation__ is sometimes reserved for those derived purely from count data, and __distributed representation__ is sometimes reserved for those that involve some kind of supervised optimization.  Here, I use  __distributed representation__ in its most general form. As we will see, many models blur the supervised/distributional distinction."

    "Here's a basic recipe for building a word $\\times$ word matrix:\n",
    "    \n",
    "0. Define a notion of co-occurrence context. This could be an entire document, a paragraph, a sentence, a clause, an NP â€” whatever domain seems likely to capture the associations you care about.\n",
    "0. Scan through your corpus building a dictionary $d$ mapping word-pairs to counts. Every time a pair of words $w$ and $w'$ occur in the same context (as you defined it in 1),  increment $d[(w, w')]$ by $1$.\n",
    "0. Using the count dictionary $d$ that you collected in 2, establish your full vocabulary $V$, an ordered list of words types. For large collections of documents, $|V|$ will typically be huge. You will probably want to winnow the vocabulary at this point. You might do this by filtering to a specific subset, or just imposing a minimum count threshold. You might impose a minimum count threshold even if $|V|$ is small &mdash; for words with very low counts, you simply don't have enough evidence to say anything interesting.\n",
    "0. Now build a matrix $M$ of dimension $|V| \\times |V|$. Both the rows and the columns of $M$ represent words. Each cell $M[i, j]$ is filled with the count $d[(w_i, w_j)]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For different design matrices, the procedure differs slightly. For example, if you are building a word $\\times$ document matrix, then the rows of $M$ represent words and the columns of $M$ represent documents. The scan in step 2 then just keeps track of (_word_, _document_) pairs &mdash; compiling the number of times that _word_ appears in _document_. Such matrices are often used in information retrieval, because the columns are multi-set representations of documents. They are much sparser than the the word $\\times$ word matrices we will work with here. (In my experience, they yield lower quality lexicons, but others have reported good results with them.)"

A method for addressing this shortcoming was proposed by [Reisinger and Mooney (2010)](https://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N10/N10-1013.pdf) building on ideas from [Sch&uuml;tze (1998)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J/J98/J98-1004.pdf). Here is a simplified version of their method:\n",

    "0. For each word $w$ in a word $\\times$ context matrix $M$, cluster the columns (contexts) containing $w$ using a clustering algorithm. \n",
    "0. For each token of $w$ in each of its contexts $d$, subscript $w$ with the cluster index of $d$ according to the clustering done in step 1.\n",
    "0. Rebuild the matrix with the rows now labeled with the expanded vocabulary obtained at step 2.\n",

The implementation below uses [Affinity Propagation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#affinity-propagation), which allows different numbers of clusters for each word, which seems desirable. [K-means](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means) actually works well too, and one could think about methods for setting $k$ for each word $w$ based on properties of the documents containing $w$."

    "The above methods rely entirely on co-occurrence patterns to achieve word representations. From a semantic perspective, this can seem unnatural.

    "Distributed approaches are compatible with grounding, though. The goal of the current section is to illustrate this possibility with a simple example involving sentiment. The guiding idea is that the labels in a sentiment lexicon provide one very specific kind of grounding, in emotional states. This information is probably not recoverable entirely from distributional facts, but we can bring it into our distributed representations.\n",

    "The method employed here for imbuing distributional vectors with sentiment information is a [shallow neural network](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial). The inputs to the network are matrices as we constructed them above. I particularly recommend applying PPMI first (count vectors will be problematic), and LSA might also be a valuable preprocessing step. Using the backpropagation algorithm, we learn a weight vector that derives hidden representations from our inputs. These  hidden representations are our word representations. If all goes well, they will encode both the distributional information present in the input vectors and the label information from our lexicon."
